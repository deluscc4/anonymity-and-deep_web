# Deep web

## This is a repository made for taking notes from my study.<br>

Decentralized and anonymous networks.

``
Bergman's definition: every part of the internet that is not directly accessible via search engines. (2001)
``

``
New definition: every connected system (network) on the internet which provides anonymity and decentralization.

**Anonymity**: nobody is capable of knowing that you are responsible for some posted content, via a decentralized VPN which does not register your connected IP.<br>
**Decentralization**: nobody is capable of remove a posted content by you, spreading web site's pieces around a bunch of computers and via also the anonymity.

## Deep web networks:<br>
**Web hosting (anonymous navigation)**: Tor, I2P, Hyperborya, Zeronet, Freenet, Ecnet, Yggdrasil, Globaleaks.<br>
**Chat (anonymous chat)**: Tox, Galet, Ricochet.<br>
