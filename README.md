# Incognito and Deep web
## This is a repository made for taking notes from my study.

**Privacity**: safeguard personal information and personal life.<br>
**Internet privacity**: taking actions on the internet without giving details on this actions to third-parties.

**Anonymity**: nameless condition.<br>
**Internet anonymity**: taking actions on the internet without revealing that I am responsible for those ones.

## What do we want to protect?

- IP: internet protocol. The responsible address to identify your internet connection. generally shared with every device using the same connection. Example of an IPv4 address (dotted-decimal notation):<br>
# 172   .   16   .   254   .   1
***10101100*** . 00010000 . 11111110 . 000000001 <br>
***One byte = Eight bits*** (total of 32 bits (4 x 8), or 4 bytes.

**Trackers**: When accessing some web sites, you have your online activities such as opened tabs and logged in accounts grabbed by the owners, in order to draw your navigation habits and give you target ads, also selling these data to others.

**Privacy Badger (anti-tracker extension)**: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp

# Data traffic
## This occurs sending packs.

### Without VPN: <br>
You >> sending a pack (request) to your ISP >> ISP sending a pack to the internet (e.g.: Google) >> Google sends the pack back to ISP >> ISP gives you the answer (non-encrypted proccess).

### Using VPN: <br>
You send the encrypted pack >> ISP receives and sends it to your VPN server >> your VPN decrypts the pack and sends it to the internet.

**Google** will grab your searches and build your wishes' profile to give you redirected ads (via IP).

## Alternative browsers:<br>
- **DuckDuckGo**: https://duckduckgo.com/
- **Startpage**: https://www.startpage.com/pt/

Startpage does not leave history. Also, it grabs your request (removing metadata) and sends it to the Google (same Engine).<br>
DuckDuckGo keeps history but removes your bind with the search.
