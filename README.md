# Data traffic
## This occurs sending packs.

### Without VPN: <br>
You >> sending a pack (request) to your ISP >> ISP sending a pack to the internet (e.g.: Google) >> Google sends the pack back to ISP >> ISP gives you the answer (non-encrypted proccess).

### Using VPN: <br>
You send the encrypted pack >> ISP receives and sends it to your VPN server >> your VPN decrypts the pack and sends it to the internet.
